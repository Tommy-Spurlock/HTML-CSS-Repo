        <h3>Hi, Customs are Good</h3>
        <p>We'll make some happy little bushes here. Just pretend you are a whisper floating across a mountain. You're the greatest thing that has ever been or ever will be. You're special. You're so very special. You need the dark in order to show the light. A big strong tree needs big strong roots.
        </p>

        <h3>Stuff I Do</h3>
        <article>We'll take a little bit of Van Dyke Brown. When you buy that first tube of paint it gives you an artist license. In life you need colors. The very fact that you're aware of suffering is enough reason to be overjoyed that you're alive and can experience it. This present moment is perfect simply due to the fact you're experiencing it.
